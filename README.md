# survey-app
This project aims to provide a platform for people to conduct surveys that contain more specialized / advanced tasks that the typical single-/ multiplechoice or freeform questions.  
As of now, it provides the following features:
1) add two types of questions: single choice or an interactive puzzle/ memoization question
2) branch the survey
3) progress specified parts of the survey in a random order 

## setup
I'll add detailed setup instructions in the weeks to come.

## issues
there are a lot of issues and todos that I am aware of and that I'll add in the following weeks as well.
